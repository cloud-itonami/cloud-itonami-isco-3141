  "FieldLabGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 3141 independent field-and-lab-science-support actor.
  Wired as its own `:govern` node in
  `field-lab-science-support.actor`'s StateGraph, downstream of
  `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of project provenance or
  research-subject/protected-site risk, so this MUST be a separate
  system able to reject a proposal (itonami actor pattern, per
  ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. project provenance  — the request's project must be registered.
    2. no-actuation          — proposal :effect must be :propose.
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off, per the
  README robotics-premise: operating near research subjects, protected
  sites or water sources always require human sign-off):
    3. :op :operate-near-research-subjects.
    4. :op :operate-near-protected-site.
    5. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
